### **The Plan: Deconstructing the Gemini CLI**

**Phase 1: The 10,000-Foot View: Architecture and Project Structure**
*   **Goal:** Understand the overall architecture, the different packages, and their primary responsibilities.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Analyze the root `package.json` to understand workspace configurations and top-level dependencies.
    2.  Read key documentation: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and especially `docs/architecture.md`.
    3.  Map out the packages in the `packages/` directory (`cli`, `core`, etc.) and form a hypothesis about their roles.

**Phase 2: The Build and Toolchain**
*   **Goal:** Document how the project is built, bundled, and prepared for distribution.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Examine the `scripts` section in `package.json` to identify core commands (`build`, `test`, `lint`, `preflight`).
    2.  Read the `Makefile`, `esbuild.config.js`, and `tsconfig.json` to understand the build process, module resolution, and TypeScript configuration.
    3.  Investigate the `scripts/` directory to understand helper scripts used for building and packaging.

**Phase 3: The Entry Point: How the CLI Boots Up**
*   **Goal:** Trace the execution flow from the user running `gemini` to the application becoming interactive.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Identify the `bin` entry in `packages/cli/package.json`.
    2.  Analyze the entry point file, likely `packages/cli/index.ts`.
    3.  Differentiate between the interactive startup (`gemini.tsx`) and non-interactive mode (`nonInteractiveCli.ts`).
    4.  Investigate `CommandService.ts` to see how user commands are parsed and delegated.

**Phase 4: The Core Logic: Tools and Services**
*   **Goal:** Deep-dive into the `core` package, which likely contains the main business logic.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Analyze `packages/core/src/index.ts` to see the public API of the core package.
    2.  Explore the `packages/core/src/tools/` directory to understand how the different capabilities (like `run_shell_command`, `read_file`) are implemented and exposed to the model.
    3.  Read `docs/core/tools-api.md` for the design philosophy.

**Phase 5: The User Interface: Rendering with Ink and React**
*   **Goal:** Understand how the interactive terminal UI is built and managed.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Analyze `packages/cli/src/ui/App.tsx`, the root component of the UI.
    2.  Explore the `components`, `hooks`, and `contexts` subdirectories to understand the UI's structure and state management.
    3.  Document the use of the Ink framework for rendering React components in the terminal.

**Phase 6: Configuration, Settings, and Authentication**
*   **Goal:** Detail how the CLI is configured and how it handles user-specific settings and authentication.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  Investigate the `packages/cli/src/config/` directory.
    2.  Read `config.ts`, `settings.ts`, and `auth.ts` to understand the configuration loading, validation, and authentication flow.
    3.  Review documentation like `docs/cli/configuration.md` and `docs/cli/authentication.md`.
